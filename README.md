   To check the distribution across the region will help us to understand the market size for each region. It will help us to do a comparative study of different markets across the region along with the profit%, so that business understands in which region we should focus to promote the products and spend for more branding and advertising to increase the revenue. 
   1. Identify the Top customers, who are actually driving the sales KPI. We need to monitor them highly.
